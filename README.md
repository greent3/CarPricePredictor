Jupyter Notebook explaining the process of viewing, cleaning, and searching for correlations in car attributes/price data prior to encoding into a Random Forest Regression model to predict the price of cars based on their attributes such as engine volume, year, etc.

This same project can be found on Kaggle by Rakesh Jarupula. However, unlike Rakesh, I chose to use Z-score for outlier detection, and I added more comments to the code (esp. in Encoding and Model sections) to make the code more readable and to demonstrate understanding.
